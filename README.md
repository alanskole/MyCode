The JS and HTML is from when I just started programming, so nothing complicated.

The Java code is more recent and complex. The parkingRental Java program is quite large and follows the SOLID principles, it has a lot of tests as well.

C programs are only related to Linux, semaphores, threads, processes etc.

Bash scripts are just simple scripts I use for my Linux OS.
