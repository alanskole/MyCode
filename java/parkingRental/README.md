The program animalObservationRegistry is for creating, reading, updating and deleting observations of animals in the future, after the year 2337; space travel is a thing, so each observation can be in a different planet.

Each observation has several objects and variables such as:

- id of the observation

- name of the observation

- an animal object, either reptile, amphibian or bird

- a planet object where it was seen

- a picture of the observation

- time and date of the observation

- comment about the observation
